# CovarianceClustering

Functions used to implement the covariance clustering approach detailed in Forknall et al. (In prep). Also provided is the dataset corresponding to the motivating example presented in the paper.

Functions depend on:
  - tidyverse
  - asreml (commercial package available from https://vsni.co.uk/software/asreml-r with licence)
  - icREML.R function (supplementary material available from Verbyla, A.P. (2019), "A note on model selection using information criteria for general linear models estimated using REML", _Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics_, 61, 39-50, https://doi.org/10.1111/anzs.12254)
